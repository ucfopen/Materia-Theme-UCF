				<h2>Our Commitment to Accessibility</h2>
				<p>
					The UCF Center for Distributed Learning is committed to ensuring federal and institutional accessibility standards are met or exceeded with Materia 
					and its ecosystem of widgets. As a product of UCF, Materia is obligated to adhere to UCF's <a href="https://policies.ucf.edu/documents/2-006.pdf" target="_blank">Digital Accessibility Policy.</a>
				</p>

				<h3>Accessibility Standards and Compliance</h3>
				<p>
					Materia widgets are often highly interactive, gamified experiences that exceed the characteristics of traditional web documents.
					While we strive to ensure adherence to WCAG 2.0 AA standards wherever possible, certain widgets may not be fully capable of supporting those standards.  
					Widgets are proactively labeled based on their level of support for two major elements of WCAG 2.0 AA standards compliance: keyboard navigation and screen reader support.

					Materia and its widgets strive to adhere to the following accessibility guidelines:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 Level AA</li>
					<li>Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act</li>
					<li>Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) digital accessibility requirements</li>
				</ul>
